# Scalable-Recommendation-System-DeKNNs
K nearest neighbor(KNN) is an eective and essential method for the Recommendation System. 
The complexity of KNN is terrible if the amount of data is huge.
The article will demonstrate two online algorithms based on two dierent cluster methods to approximate KNN graph. 
They are called K-Means Democratization KNN(KM-DeKNN) and Item-based DeKNN(It-DeKNN). DeKNNs will converge eventually.
